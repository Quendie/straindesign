    "The cobra package is shipped with the **GLPK** solver. The more powerful commercial solvers **IBM CPLEX** and **Gurobi** may be used by COBRApy and also by the StrainDesign package. As another alternative solver, **SCIP** can be employed. Using alternative solvers makes sense, in particular, when using strain design algorithms like MCS, OptKnock etc. Their support of indicator contstraints renders computations significantly more stable.\n",

    "Together with Gurobi, CPLEX is the perfect choice for computing strain designs. Its stability and support of advanced features like indicator constraints and populating solution pools make it indispensible for genome-scale computations.\n",

    "You will need an academic or commercial licence for CPLEX. Download and install the CPLEX suite and make sure that your CPLEX and Python versions are compatible.
