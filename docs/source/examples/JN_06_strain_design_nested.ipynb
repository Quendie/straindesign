    "# Multi-level strain optimization approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Several strain design approaches use MILPs with nested optimization to enforce growth-coupled production. As the first nested optimization algorithm, OptKnock aimed to resolve the conflict between the microbial objective of fast growth with the engineering goal of fast production. It therefore constructs a max-max problem for the maximization of product synthesis under the assumption that the cell itself, will maximize its growth rate. One problem is that this formulation leads to overly optimistic strain designs, since it assumes that a cell would maximize production when attaining its maximal growth rate. In the worst case, however (potentially growth coupled prodcution), a cell might turn off production completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Successors of OptKnock, such as RobustKnock and OptCouple have overcome this problem since they guarantee production at maximum growth (weakly growth-coupled production). In the following sections we will explain how one can compute strain designs with OptKnock, RobustKnock and OptCouple, and how these methods can be combined with the minimial cut set approach."
